Repo of all sites 

This is a repo of most of the website that I have coded. 
Languages used are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript. 

To open up you can start with index.html

All websites were created by Martin M. Rivers of Rivers Technology.
This repo also serves as a portfolio for Martin M. Rivers.
